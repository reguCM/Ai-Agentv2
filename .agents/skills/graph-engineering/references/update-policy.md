# Durable Knowledge Update Policy

## Read before writing

Search for the repository's existing knowledge homes first:

1. architecture documentation and diagrams;
2. accepted or proposed ADRs;
3. package and service README files;
4. contributor or agent instructions;
5. issue, design, and implementation-plan conventions.

Update the closest existing source of truth. When no suitable home exists and the knowledge will remain useful across multiple tasks, propose `docs/agent-context/`. Never create that directory without explicit user approval.

## Persistence threshold

Persist a claim only when all are true:

- **Durable:** likely to remain useful after the current task.
- **Material:** changes future implementation, review, operations, or safety decisions.
- **Supported:** carries evidence or is explicitly labelled as proposed or unknown.
- **Scoped:** belongs in the selected document without duplicating another source of truth.
- **Safe:** contains no secrets, personal data, hidden reasoning, raw logs, or ephemeral execution state.

If any condition fails, keep the result in the current response rather than repository documentation.

Keep raw command output session-local. Persist only redacted summaries and enough command or path context to reproduce the evidence safely.

## Allowed updates

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Current evidence confirms existing knowledge | Keep it; refresh the verification marker only if the repository uses one. |
| Current evidence changes a durable fact | Update the fact and cite the new evidence. |
| A decision replaces an older decision | Mark the new decision as `supersedes`; preserve and link the older record. |
| Sources conflict | Record the conflict as `unknown`; do not choose silently. |
| Knowledge is stale but still historically useful | Add a stale or superseded marker and a current pointer. |
| Knowledge is wrong and has no historical value | Remove it only when authorized and the replacement evidence is clear. |

## Authorization boundary

Treat requests to analyze, explain, review, or diagnose as read-only. A request to create or update documentation authorizes only the smallest relevant knowledge change. Do not expand it into repository-wide documentation cleanup.

Before writing, state or internally verify:

- target document and why it is the correct source of truth;
- exact durable claims being added, changed, or superseded;
- evidence for each claim;
- links or indexes that must remain valid.

After writing, verify links, headings, referenced paths, and consistency with adjacent documentation. Report what changed and which unknowns remain.
